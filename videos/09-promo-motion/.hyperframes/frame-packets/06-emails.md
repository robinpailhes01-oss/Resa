Scene 2 (0.8–3.2s) : le titre se construit mot par mot en haut : « Confirmation, » / « rappel, » / « avis. » — à chaque mot, un arc lumineux se dessine du hub vers une carte qui s'allume (`svg-path-draw` + `avatar-cloud-network`) : carte 1 « Confirmation de réservation · envoyée tout de suite », carte 2 « Rappel · la veille du rendez-vous », carte 3 « Demande d'avis Google · après la visite ».
Scene 3 (3.0–4.5s) : « Automatiques. » arrive en accent lavande ; la caméra pousse doucement vers la carte 3, les autres passent en flou (`depth-of-field-blur`) ; tenue.

## Selected blueprint: constellation-hub

# constellation-hub — Constellation / Hub + Satellites

**intent**: Labeled/iconned nodes spring into a ring/cluster around a center, then the shot resolves on the core — either by pushing the camera INTO the center (depth-of-field collapsing onto it) or by holding a hub mark while the satellites ORBIT it; the "everything connects to / sits around one center" beat.

**roles served**

- Hook (from `hook-cluster-push-in`): a constellation of tool/app nodes springs into a wide ring, then a sustained camera push-in with depth-of-field resolves on the inner core — "it connects everything / one hub for all your tools."
- Social_Proof (from `social-proof-orbit-ecosystem`): the product brand mark lands as the center hub and partner logos spring onto a ring and revolve around it — "plugs into / sits at the center of your stack."
- CTA (from `cta-orbit-collapse`): the ring resolves by COLLAPSE rather than a push-in — category icons drift around an empty central CTA, a cursor click implodes the orbit toward the click point, and the product demo springs OUT of that collapse as the answer (scope → choice → consequence → product).
- Social_Proof (from `proof-logo-chain`): a persistent center logo accrues proofs — its wordmark decodes, a claim ticker swaps, the logo glides to center, then avatars cascade into orbit with drawn connectors while partner logos scroll the bottom strip; four claims read as one statement.
- Social_Proof (from `scatter-drift-finisher`): the ecosystem beat as a
  static END CARD — a two-line serif `[headline]` is the center (no hub mark, no ring), `[~20 app
icons]` pop in scattered frame-wide in a quick stagger, then keep drifting very slowly OUTWARD
  to the end. "Connects to thousands of apps" said with count and spread, not geometry.

**duration**: 5–8s (Hook 5–6s · Social_Proof 5–8s · CTA orbit-collapse ~6s · Social_Proof
scatter-drift end card ~2.5s as a closing beat)

**shot structure**

Consolidated template — nodes ring a center, then one of two finishers resolves on the core.

- Scene 1 (0.0–~1.5s): `[bg]` (dark/space field, optionally slow-drifting diffused gradient blobs). `[primary nodes]` (circles carrying `[icon]` + label) SPRING-POP in (scale 0→1, ~1.15 elastic overshoot, staggered) arranged in a wide ring/cluster around an empty or marked center `[hub]`.
- Scene 2 (~0.7–2.5s, overlapping): smaller `[secondary nodes]` (platform / partner-logo chips) pop in staggered with the same elastic spring, filling the gaps; optional thin `[accent]` connector lines / orbit ring draw from hub→nodes. Camera holds.
- Scene 3 (~2.5–Xs, the resolve): see finisher variant below; lands and HOLDS on the magnified / orbited center to the end.

- Variant — Hook (push-in finisher): from Scene 3, a continuous smooth CAMERA PUSH-IN toward the center inner cluster — inner nodes scale up and stay sharp while outer nodes are pushed toward the edges and progressively BLUR (depth-of-field), background scales up smoothly; holds magnified on the core.
- Variant — Social_Proof (orbit finisher): the center `[brand mark]` snaps in via a quick 3D rotate that decelerates and settles; a thin `[accent]` orbit ring draws around it; `[N partner badges]` spring onto the ring (staggered overshoot) and revolve CLOCKWISE while staying upright, under a continuous slow camera ZOOM-OUT (ecosystem reveal).
- Variant — Social_Proof (optional type-push-through opener, prepended before Scene 1): centered `[headline]` types/slides in with a huge transparent-fill OUTLINE copy of the same words behind it; the outline text scales up exponentially toward camera (high-speed dolly / push-through), breaches the frame, then HARD-CUTS to the hub bg of Scene 1.
- Variant — Social_Proof (scatter-drift finisher, no ring): the center is a two-line serif
  `[headline]` building in place (not a mark); `[~20 app icons]` pop in SCATTERED across the whole
  frame in a quick stagger — no ring geometry, no connectors — then sustain a very slow outward
  drift to the end. Camera fully static: no push-in, no zoom-out; the "everything around one
  center" reads from the drift vectors pointing away from the headline. Often chained as the end
  card of a preceding UI beat (the prior card dissolves into it).

**motion vocabulary**: staggered elastic spring-pop node entrances (~1.15 overshoot); slow gradient-blob drift; connector-line / orbit-ring draw-on; 3D snap-rotate-settle on the hub mark; continuous camera push-in (inner sharp, outer depth-of-field blur, bg scale-up); clockwise orbital revolve of upright badges; continuous slow camera zoom-out (ecosystem reveal); optional outline-text push-through dolly entry. Scatter-drift finisher: frame-wide scattered icon pop-in (staggered, no ring); sustained slow
outward icon drift; in-place two-line serif headline build; static-frame hold to the end.

**rule mapping** (motion verb → `rules/<id>.md`)

- staggered spring-pop node entrances → `spring-pop-entrance` (elastic overshoot) + `gsap-effects` (stagger recipe); 3D-flip-in flavor → `orbit-3d-entry`
- ring / cluster layout of nodes around a center → `avatar-cloud-network` (nodes on an elliptical ring + SVG lines to a center)
- icons on the nodes → `svg-icon-enrichment`
- connector lines hub→node → `svg-path-draw`
- orbit-ring draw-on → `svg-path-draw`
- slow gradient-blob drift → `sine-wave-loop` (idle looped drift)
- 3D snap-rotate-settle on hub mark → `orbit-3d-entry` (3D-flip entry); technique CSS-3D
- clockwise orbital revolve of upright badges → `orbit-3d-entry` (continuous elliptical orbit); technique MotionPath
- camera push-in toward center → `multi-phase-camera` (PUSH-in) + `coordinate-target-zoom` (target the core)
- background scale-up during push-in → `multi-phase-camera`
- continuous slow zoom-out (ecosystem reveal) → `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back) / `coordinate-target-zoom`
- outline-text push-through dolly opener (Social_Proof) → `3d-text-depth-layers` (outline copy behind) + `multi-phase-camera` (push-through)
- depth-of-field blur on outer nodes during push-in → `depth-of-field-blur` (progressive DOF/focus-falloff blur on the off-center outer nodes while the inner core stays sharp)
- frame-wide scattered icon pop-in (no ring) → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group) +
  `gsap-effects` (stagger recipe); positions pre-baked scattered — NOT `avatar-cloud-network`'s
  elliptical ring
- sustained slow outward icon drift → `center-outward-expansion` (outward vectors, slow sustained
  register — drift targets sit slightly past the pop-in positions)
- in-place serif headline build → `gsap-effects` (staggered line/word reveal)

**camera modifier**: push-in-with-DOF (Hook) — `multi-phase-camera` PUSH-in targeted via `coordinate-target-zoom` onto the core; the focus-falloff blur half of it is backed by `depth-of-field-blur`. Orbit finisher (Social_Proof) — slow continuous zoom-out via `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back) while satellites revolve. Scatter-drift finisher (Social_Proof end card) — none: the frame never moves; the outward drift
is element-level.

# Avatar Cloud Network

Avatars on an elliptical ring around a central hub (logo / counter), with SVG dashed lines drawing outward from the hub to each avatar — "community" / social proof. Distinct from [orbit-3d-entry.md](orbit-3d-entry.md) (continuous orbit): this settles into a static composed formation.

## How It Works

Three layers: SVG lines (z-index 1, behind), avatars (z-index 2), hub (z-index 5 — lines terminate AT its edge, never pass through). Avatar positions and lines are built once at setup from ONE shared center; the timeline then runs hub fade → avatar cascade → outward line draw → breathing dwell. Drawing FROM the center is the narrative: "the hub connects to its community."

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<svg class="lines" viewBox="0 0 1920 1080"><!-- lines injected --></svg>
<div class="hub-wrap">
  <div class="hub">{counterValue} {counterLabel}</div>
  <!-- avatars injected -->
</div>
```

```css
.lines {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  z-index: 1;
  pointer-events: none;
}
.hub-wrap {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
.hub {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 5;
}
.avatar {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 2;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%); /* centers on the (left, top) the script sets */
  will-change: transform, opacity;
}
```

```js
// CENTER_X/Y must equal the hub's RENDERED center exactly — every avatar
// position and line endpoint derives from it. For a place-items:center hub on
// a 1920×1080 canvas: (W/2, H × CENTER_Y_FACTOR).
const C = { x: CENTER_X, y: CENTER_Y };
const wrap = document.querySelector(".hub-wrap");
const svg = document.querySelector(".lines");

for (let i = 0; i < AVATAR_COUNT; i++) {
  const a = (i / AVATAR_COUNT) * Math.PI * 2 - Math.PI / 2; // start at top
  const x = C.x + Math.cos(a) * RADIUS_X;
  const y = C.y + Math.sin(a) * RADIUS_Y;

  const av = document.createElement("div");
  av.className = "avatar"; // assign image / glyph from authoring data
  av.style.left = `${x}px`;
  av.style.top = `${y}px`;
  wrap.appendChild(av);

  const line = document.createElementNS("http://www.w3.org/2000/svg", "line");
  const attrs = {
    x1: C.x,
    y1: C.y,
    x2: x,
    y2: y,
    stroke: "{lineColor}",
    "stroke-dasharray": "6 8",
  };
  Object.entries(attrs).forEach(([k, v]) => line.setAttribute(k, String(v)));
  const len = Math.hypot(x - C.x, y - C.y); // straight line — Math.hypot, not getTotalLength()
  line.style.strokeDashoffset = String(len);
  svg.appendChild(line);
}

tl.from(".hub", { opacity: 0, scale: 0.8, duration: HUB_DUR, ease: `back.out(${HUB_BOUNCE})` }, 0);

const avatars = document.querySelectorAll(".avatar");
avatars.forEach((av, i) => {
  tl.from(
    av,
    { opacity: 0, scale: 0, duration: AVATAR_DUR, ease: `back.out(${AVATAR_BOUNCE})` },
    AVATAR_AT + i * AVATAR_STAGGER,
  );
});
svg.querySelectorAll("line").forEach((line, i) => {
  tl.to(
    line,
    { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: LINE_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
    LINES_AT + i * LINE_STAGGER,
  );
});

// Climax dwell — out-of-phase breathing holds the eye on the formed network:
// one phase proxy (0 → 2π·BREATH_CYCLES, ease "none"); onUpdate scales avatar i by
// 1 + sin(p + (i/n)·2π) · BREATH_AMP — sine-wave-loop's multiplicative onUpdate form.
// Keep the -50% centering in the same transform write.
```

## Variations

- **Size variety**: vary avatar sizes by a small index-keyed array so the ring doesn't read rigidly repetitive.
- **Solid lines**: drop the dash + draw; lines fade in via opacity — more corporate, less networky.
- **Multi-orbit**: inner ring (fewer, larger) connected to the hub; outer ring is an unconnected "halo."
- **Glyph avatars**: flags / emoji / icons instead of faces — reads "global community" or role spread.

| BREATH_CYCLES  | 1.0–2.0 over the remaining s | under 1 = single sigh; over 2 = anxious. BREATH_AMP 0.02–0.06    |

Tokens: dark `{bgColor}` so the cloud reads as a constellation; translucent accent `{lineColor}`; soft border + glow keeps avatars legible on dark.

## Critical Constraints

- **CENTER_X/Y must match the hub's actual rendered center** — when composed with another scene (e.g. a recentered logo), bake them from the same source as the hub's final position, or lines visibly miss the hub.
- **Hub z-index above lines** — lines terminate at the hub edge, never cross it.
- **Lines draw outward** (dashoffset len → 0), starting after avatars are mostly settled.
- **`RADIUS_X > RADIUS_Y`** — a horizontal ellipse reads as perspective; a circle reads flat.
- **Climax dwell ≥ 1s** after lines complete so the formed network is readable.
- Straight lines: `Math.hypot` for length — `getTotalLength()` not needed.

# Depth-of-Field Blur (Selective Focus / Rack Focus)

Pulls the eye to one focal element by **blurring** (and slightly **dimming**) everything around it while the focal layer stays sharp — the camera's depth-of-field falling off the background, or a rack-focus shifting which plane is in focus. `filter` and `opacity` are paint-only, so both tween seek-safe. This is the backing rule for the focus-falloff beat the blueprints reach for: outer nodes blurring during a push-in (`constellation-hub`), rack-focus across a parallax card stack (`cursor-ui-demo`), non-highlighted cards dimming to spotlight a hero metric (`dataviz-countup`).

## How It Works

Every layer carries a `--dof` custom property (px of blur), read by `filter: blur(var(--dof))`, plus its own `opacity`. A GSAP tween advances each layer's `--dof` from `0` to its target blur and its opacity from `1` to a dim level over the focus-shift window. The focal layer's `--dof` stays `0`. Per-layer targets derive from `data-depth` / index, so the falloff is identical on every seek.

Three mechanics, same primitive:

1. **Focal pull** — one window: off-focus layers go sharp(0) → blurred while the focal layer holds at 0. The eye is pulled to the only thing still crisp.
2. **Rack focus** — two adjacent windows on the same property: plane A's blur ramps 0 → max at the same position plane B's ramps max → 0. State continuity matters exactly as in `press-release-spring`: A's resting blur after the rack must equal what B held before it — author both as tweens on the same `--dof` at the same position so the hand-off is seamless.
3. **Blur-the-cluster-while-pushing-in** — the DoF tween runs at the SAME timeline position as a camera push-in (`multi-phase-camera` / `coordinate-target-zoom`): "the world recedes" and "we push in" read as one move.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="world" id="world">
  <!-- Focal layer — stays sharp -->
  <div class="layer focal" id="focal">{FocalLabel}</div>
  <!-- Off-focus layers — blur + dim; data-depth orders near→far -->
  <div class="layer ctx" data-depth="1">{Context A}</div>
  <div class="layer ctx" data-depth="2">{Context B}</div>
  <div class="layer ctx" data-depth="3">{Context C}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.world {
  /* single wrapper so a concurrent camera push-in transforms everything
     together; DoF is independent of the camera */
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%;
}
.layer {
  --dof: 0px; /* px of blur; filter reads it — starts sharp */
  filter: blur(var(--dof));
  will-change: filter; /* promotes the layer so per-frame re-rasterization is cheap */
}
.focal {
  z-index: 2; /* sharp layer must sit ABOVE the blurred ones, or its crisp
     edges read as bleeding into the haze */
}
.ctx {
  z-index: 1;
}
```

```js
// Mechanic 1 — FOCAL PULL. Blur scales with data-depth so far planes blur
// more than near ones; the focal layer (--dof: 0, opacity: 1) is untouched.
gsap.utils.toArray(".ctx").forEach((el) => {
  const depth = Number(el.dataset.depth) || 1;
  tl.to(
    el,
    {
      "--dof": `${BLUR_PER_DEPTH * depth}px`,
      opacity: DIM_LEVEL, // dim, not gone
      duration: FOCUS_DUR,
      ease: "power2.inOut",
    },
    FOCUS_START,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Rack focus between two depth planes** — `gsap.set` plane B pre-blurred BEFORE the rack (no pop), then two tweens sharing `RACK_START` + `RACK_DUR`: A → `MAX_BLUR` + `DIM_LEVEL`, B → `0px` + `1`. Shared window makes them cross at the midpoint.
- **Blur the cluster while pushing in** — run the focal-pull tweens at the same position + duration as a camera tween on `#world` (`scale/x/y`, `power2.inOut`). Camera transforms the world; DoF tweens the layers — independent property channels, no conflict.
- **Spotlight a hero metric in a card grid** — `gsap.utils.toArray(".card:not(.hero)")` all defocus (`GRID_BLUR` + `DIM_LEVEL`) on one shared window; heroes are skipped.
- **Refocus / settle** — if the beat resolves back to "everything visible" (or hands off to a crossfade needing a clean outgoing frame), ramp all `--dof` back to `0px` / opacity 1 over the tail (`REFOCUS_START + REFOCUS_DUR ≤ DURATION`).
- **Bounded focus-breathing on the focal layer (optional)** — a finite `ease:"none"` driver writes `Math.max(0, Math.sin(p)) * FOCAL_BREATH_PX` into the focal `--dof` during a hold. Keep it ≤ ~0.6px or it reads as "still focusing"; default to omitting it.

| FOCAL vs CTX sizing   | context smaller / grouped              | small context layers let a modest radius still read as "out of focus" — and blur cheaply                 |

Tokens: dark `{bgGradient}` so the sharp focal layer reads as lit and forward; heavy display `{font}` weight — blurred copy needs it to stay shape-legible.

## Critical Constraints

- **Tween the `--dof` variable on the timeline** — reading `filter: blur(var(--dof))` keeps the blur on the HF seek clock.
- **Blur the SMALL / GROUPED layers, not the giant one.** Filter cost scales with radius × pixel area; a 20 px blur on a full-frame background is the worst case. Keep per-layer radius ≤ ~24 px on large surfaces and lean on the `opacity` **dim** to do the push-back work — dim + modest blur reads more like real DoF than blur cranked to the max.
- **`will-change: filter`** on every layer whose blur animates (drop it after settle if the layer also does heavy transform work).
- **Focal layer stays genuinely sharp** — `--dof: 0`, untouched (or breathing ≤ 0.6 px). Any visible blur on the focal element kills the "this is the thing" read.
- **State continuity on a rack** — the outgoing plane starts at the blur the incoming plane was holding, and vice-versa; adjacent tweens on the same `--dof` at the same position.
- **DoF is independent of the camera** — blur the layers, transform `.world` for the push-in; don't fake DoF with the camera transform or vice-versa.
- **Settle sharp before a hand-off** — refocus to `--dof: 0` in the tail if the next beat is a crossfade/push; handing off mid-defocus reads as "the render glitched."

# Spring-Pop Entrance

> **Smooth beats bouncy.** This entrance defaults to a smooth long-tail settle — `power3.out` (or `expo.out` for a faster front) — that decelerates cleanly into the resting size with **no overshoot**. Bouncy `back.out` is the **#1 instant turn-off** in agent-made videos and is almost never executed well; it is a rare, explicitly-playful exception (consumer / fun brand), never the default. When unsure, settle smoothly.

THE entrance primitive: an element (or staggered group) arrives by springing from nothing — `scale: 0 → 1`, optional small `y` rise — and settles without bouncing. This is **arrival**, not reaction: distinct from [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md) (a click/press → release feedback chain on an element that already rests on screen). Many blueprints used to borrow that rule to fake an entrance; reach for this instead.

## How It Works

One `fromTo` carries the whole arrival: from `{ scale: 0, opacity: 0 }` (explicit, so t=0 is correct under seek) to `{ scale: 1, opacity: 1, ease: "power3.out" }`. For a **group**, the same `fromTo` runs per element at `i * STAGGER`, capped so the group reads as one arriving beat. The `scale` grow is load-bearing; the `y` rise is garnish — drop everything else and it must still read as a clean entrance. Let the ease produce the settle: never hand-key a `scale: 1.1` mid-state (it double-bounces against the curve).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="pop-hero" id="hero">{heroLabel}</div>

<div class="pop-grid">
  <div class="pop-item">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.pop-hero,
.pop-item {
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* in-place pop; move to the source point for the anchored variation */
  will-change: transform;
}
.pop-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: GRID_GAP;
  place-items: center;
}
```

```js
// Single hero pop — smooth long-tail settle, no overshoot.
tl.fromTo(
  "#hero",
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0 },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  ENTRY_AT,
);

// Staggered group pop — one arriving beat.
gsap.utils.toArray(".pop-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { scale: 0, opacity: 0, y: Y_RISE },
    { scale: 1, opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
    GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Calm settle** (premium / enterprise): `power3.out`, no rotation, `Y_RISE` 0–12px — a weighted, confident landing for a hero wordmark or product shot.
- **Firm settle** (everyday default): `power3.out` or `expo.out` for a punchier front, `Y_RISE` ~24px — cards, icons, callouts.
- **Exact-physics settle**: when the settle IS the shot, swap the ease for `springEase({ response: 0.4 })` (critically damped) from `../adapters/gsap-easing-and-stagger.md` → Spring Eases; take `duration` from the helper.
- **Origin-anchored pop**: a callout growing out of a specific point (marker, pointer tip) sets `transform-origin` to that point (e.g. `0% 100%`) so `scale: 0 → 1` reads as "emerging from the source", not "inflating in place".
- **Pop into a held slot**: land the pop and hold still — no idle loop baked into the entrance. If the held frame genuinely needs life, hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) for subtle jitter on a separate later tween; prefer revealing the next element on its VO cue.
- **Bouncy pop (RARE — explicitly-playful only)**: swap the ease for `back.out(OVERSHOOT)` and optionally settle a small `rotation: ROT_FROM → 0` so elements look hand-placed. Only for a deliberately playful register — never product / enterprise / serious tone:

```js
tl.fromTo(
  el,
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0, rotation: ROT_FROM },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, rotation: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: `back.out(${OVERSHOOT})` },
  GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
);
```

Even here keep `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2` — past that it reads as cartoon wobble. Better still: the baked spring at `dampingFraction: 0.6–0.7` (same adapters doc) gives ~5–10% overshoot that reads physical where `back.out` reads cartoon.

| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |

| POP_DUR    | 0.4–0.7s                                  | shorter = tight snap; hero must be visible by **t ≤ 0.5s**       |
| STAGGER    | 0.04–0.08s                                | `min(0.06, 0.5 / ITEM_COUNT)` — self-caps the window             |
| ITEM_COUNT | 3–9                                       | >9 makes the stagger vanish — switch to a wipe/sweep reveal      |
| Y_RISE     | 0–32px                                    | small; never large enough to read as a slide-up                  |
| ROT_FROM   | −10°–+10°                                 | playful variant only; alternate sign by index (`i % 2 ? 6 : -6`) |
| ENTRY_AT   | 0–0.4s                                    | a beat of quiet, but keep the subject landing by t ≤ 0.5s        |

## Critical Constraints

- Default ease `power3.out` (no overshoot); `back.out` only in the explicitly-playful variant, and there `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2`.
- `ITEM_COUNT × STAGGER ≤ ~0.5s` — the group must land inside one beat.
- Entrances state the collapsed from-state in `fromTo` — never rely on a CSS-hidden start (it renders visible before the tween claims it under seek).
- `transform-origin: 50% 50%` for an in-place pop; the source point only for the anchored variation.
- This is a finite arrival — idle motion on a held element is a separate, later `sine-wave-loop` tween.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

## Values

| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
