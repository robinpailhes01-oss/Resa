name: Blue Professional — Frame (video / frame layer)
description: >
  Video-first companion to Blue Professional's design.md. The unit is the frame (1920×1080). Atoms
  are identical and sacred — the warm cream canvas, a single saturated cobalt (#1e2bfa) as the only
  accent, the three-step gray text ladder, Outfit (display/numerals/chrome) + Outfit (body),
  soft cobalt-tinted cards (4% fill / 20% border / 10–14px radius) with NO shadows, pill chrome, and
  the cobalt progress bar. Composition + frame scale rewritten. Motion out of scope.
unit: the frame — 1920×1080 primary; 9:16 and 1:1 documented

# Blue Professional — Frame (video / frame layer)

## Reso adaptation (overrides everything below)

- **Stage**: the video plays on a **powder-blue stage** (`stage` #617990 → `stage-deep` #3E5166 radial gradient, soft vignette, faint cream hairline grid at 6% and long luminous arcs in cream at 25%), the same wall colour as the reso® brand sting. Never pure black, never purple.
- **UI cards** float on it: real app screenshots inside cream (`card` #FFFDF8) device frames / panels with 22–28px radius, a 1px `border` hairline and a soft long shadow `0 60px 120px -40px rgba(31,39,51,.55)` — depth comes from shadows + perspective, it is a 3D motion piece (the preset's "no shadow" rule does NOT apply here).
- **Type on stage**: Outfit 500, lowercase-leaning sentence case, cream (`text-on-stage`), tight tracking −0.03em; kicker labels in JetBrains Mono uppercase 0.18em, cream at 70%.
- **Accent**: lavender #B6A6D8 sparingly (cursor, active slot, glow on the CTA, a single highlighted word). Ink #1F2733 for the CTA pill text and dark buttons.
- Signature: logo `assets/logo-reso-creme.svg` + « BEAUTY BUSINESS SIMPLIFIED » in Outfit tracked 0.34em.

## Brand adaptation (READ FIRST — the frontmatter is the source of truth)

This is the **blue-professional** preset remixed onto the captured brand. The YAML frontmatter above (colors · typography · components) is **normative and already correct — use it verbatim.** The prose below is the ORIGINAL preset's intent; read it THROUGH the frontmatter:

- **Fonts** — **Outfit** (display) / **Manrope** (body) / **JetBrains Mono** (labels); ignore any preset font name lingering in prose.
- **Colors** — use the frontmatter hex; preset color NAMES in prose (e.g. "cobalt", "cream") mean the remapped brand values.


## Overview

Blue Professional at frame scale is a **consulting-grade system: restraint with one strong
commitment.** A warm cream canvas and a single saturated cobalt that carries every accent —
eyebrow, metric, CTA, chart fill, progress bar. No secondary brand color, no pastels, just cream,
cobalt, and a tight ladder of grays. The register is investment-research / McKinsey briefing:
measured, data-dense without crowding, executive-readable at distance.

The voice is two faces in fixed roles: **Outfit** (display, every numeral, all chrome —
eyebrows uppercase 0.08em) and **Outfit** (body, muted gray, line 1.6). Headlines are near-black;
cobalt is reserved for accent moments. Depth is **soft and tinted** — 4% cobalt card fills with 20%
cobalt borders and 10–14px radii — never shadowed. The lack of harsh shadows is the premium signal.

**Key characteristics at frame scale:**

- **Warm cream ground** on every frame; **single cobalt** as the only accent.
- **Outfit** (display/numerals/chrome) + **Outfit** (body) — near-black headlines, cobalt numerals.
- **Tinted cards** — cobalt 4% fill, cobalt 20% 1.5px border, 10–14px radius, **no shadow**.
- **Pill chrome** (100px) — tag pills + the one solid cobalt CTA; cobalt **progress bar**.
- **Soft rounded corners everywhere** (no square corners save the progress bar).
- **Atmosphere** (diagonal panel, dot grid, concentric rings) on cover/closing only.

## The Frame

### Frame Craft Bar

Three eyeball tests gate every frame before any structural check:

- **Squint** — one **near-black headline or cobalt numeral** dominates at 3–6× its neighbor.
- **Silence** — content frames read **balanced, not crowded**; the **dashboard is the one dense exception**.
- **Restraint** — a **single cobalt accent** carries everything; headlines stay near-black (never cobalt); no shadows (tinted cards do the lift); positive/negative inline-text only.
- **Reference** — aim at an **investment-research / McKinsey quarterly briefing**; failure looks like a **heavy-outlined, multi-color dashboard**.

- **Primary:** 1920×1080 (16:9). Display authored in **`cqw`** (`px ÷ 1920 × 100 = cqw`).
- **Vertical:** 1080×1920 (9:16). **Square:** 1080×1080 (1:1).
- **Safe area:** `pad-x` 5cqw; bottom reserves room for the counter + progress bar.

**The container law (load-bearing).** Every frame ground sets `container-type: size`; ALL
frame-relative units are `cqw`/`cqh` against it — never `vw`. Card radii stay px (10–14px); the
pill radius stays 100px; borders stay 1–1.5px.

## Colors

Tokens identical to the source. `{colors.bg}` cream is the universal ground; `{colors.primary}`
cobalt is the **only** accent — every eyebrow, numeral, CTA, chart fill, progress bar, and the 4px
highlight left-rule. Headlines are `{colors.text}` near-black (never cobalt); body is
`{colors.text-muted}`; tertiary is `{colors.text-light}`. Cards fill `{colors.card-bg}` (4%) with
`{colors.border}` (20%) borders. `{colors.positive}`/`{colors.negative}` appear **only inline** on
directional change chips — never as fills. **No second accent color.**

## Typography

Two ramps. The **reading ramp** (Outfit body 0.85cqw muted; Outfit eyebrow uppercase 0.08em
cobalt) carries copy + chrome; the **display/numerical ramp** (Outfit `h3` 1.25cqw → `h1`
4.2cqw near-black; numerals `stat-num`/`metric-value` in cobalt) carries headings and figures.

- **Legibility floor:** any load-bearing line ≥ **1.4cqw**; px chrome (tag/counter) is colophon only.
- **Fit-to-measure:** size the headline to its length. Cap the block at **≤ 78cqw**; ≤3 words → `h1`; 4–6 → `h2`; 7+ → `h3`. Cobalt numerals scale `metric-value`→`stat-num` by card size.
- **Headlines near-black, −0.02em**; **eyebrows cobalt, uppercase, 0.08em**; **numerals cobalt 600–700**; **body Outfit 400 muted, line 1.6**. No italic, no uppercase body, no cobalt headline.

## Depth & Surface

Soft and tinted — never offset. Depth from:

- **Tinted cards** — 4% cobalt fill + 20% cobalt 1.5px border + 10–14px radius reads as lifted without offset.
- **Border-left accent** — the 4px cobalt rule on split-highlight blocks pulls a callout forward.
- **Rounded corners** — the 10–14px radius is part of the softness; square corners break it.

**Ceiling:** zero box-shadow on content (the only shadow is a soft cobalt CTA _hover_); no opaque cobalt borders; no harsh outlines.

## Shapes

- **100px** — tag pills, CTA, nav buttons (pill chrome).
- **14/12/10px** — cards by size (large metric / standard stat / detail + mini).
- **6px** — bar tracks + fills. **50%** — step circles, nav circles, dots, closing rings.
- **0** — only the progress bar. No square-cornered content.

## Components

- **card-tinted / metric-card** — the universal soft-tint content cards (no shadow).
- **tag-pill / cta-button / accent-line** — the cobalt pill chrome + the one solid CTA + the 60×4 rule.
- **bar-track / step-circle / split-highlight** — cobalt data + sequence + callout patterns.
- **slide-header** (eyebrow + tag pill) — the structural rhythm; **atmosphere** (diagonal/dots/rings) on cover/closing only; **progress-bar** on every frame.

## Frame Treatments

> Recipe: ground · container · composes · focal · chrome · accent · silence · Fixed/Free · density.
> Atmosphere only on cover/closing; content frames carry the slide-header rhythm.

### 1 · Cover (identity · move: diagonal accent · left)

**Ground** cream + the clipped diagonal cobalt-tint panel (right ~36%) + a 3×3 cobalt dot grid.
**Composes** accent-line, meta, h1, body sub. **Focal** a 2-line Outfit `h1` near-black, left,
under a cobalt accent-line + meta. **Chrome** counter + progress bar. **Accent** the cobalt line +
diagonal panel. **Silence** the diagonal panel holds the right third. **Fixed** near-black h1, cobalt
accents, atmosphere here only. **Free** title, meta. **Density** low.

### 2 · Dashboard (data · move: 3-up metric grid · the dense frame)

**Ground** cream, `pad-x`. **Composes** slide-header (eyebrow + tag-pill), h2, 3× metric/tinted card.
**Focal** a row of tinted cards — cobalt `metric-value` + Outfit label + muted desc + optional
green/red change chip. **Chrome** eyebrow left, tag-pill right; progress bar. **Accent** the cobalt
numerals. **Silence** tight — the density exception. **Fixed** 4% tint cards, 20% borders, no shadow,
cobalt numerals. **Free** figures (from script), labels. **Density** dense-exception.

### 3 · Bar Ranking (data · move: cobalt bars · left)

**Ground** cream, `pad-x`. **Composes** eyebrow, h2, bar-track rows. **Focal** 3–5 labeled
cobalt-fill bars on cobalt-8% tracks with cobalt percentages. **Chrome** eyebrow; progress bar.
**Accent** the cobalt fills + figures. **Silence** moderate. **Fixed** 6px tracks, cobalt fills.
**Free** rows, values (from script). **Density** standard.

### 4 · Pull Quote (quote · move: concentric rings · centered)

**Ground** cream, centered, with faint concentric closing-rings behind. **Composes** quote-mark,
blockquote, cite. **Focal** a Outfit `blockquote` near-black under a 15%-opacity cobalt
quote-mark; an uppercase cobalt-muted cite beneath. **Accent** the faint rings + quote-mark. **Silence**
~55%. **Fixed** near-black quote, soft rings. **Free** quote, cite. **Density** low.

### 5 · Split + Highlight (content · move: asymmetric split · left)

**Ground** cream, two columns. **Composes** eyebrow, h2, body, split-highlight block. **Focal** an
Outfit body column beside a cobalt-8% highlight block (4px cobalt left rule) carrying an inline pull
quote. **Accent** the highlight's left rule. **Silence** generous gutter. **Fixed** tinted highlight,
4px cobalt rule. **Free** body, callout. **Density** standard.

### 6 · Closing / CTA (closer · move: centered rings + CTA)

**Ground** cream + concentric closing-rings. **Composes** accent-line, h1, body, cta-button. **Focal**
a Outfit `h1` near-black, centered, with the one solid cobalt `cta-button` pill below. **Accent**
the CTA + rings. **Silence** ~60%. **Fixed** one CTA, near-black h1, soft rings. **Free** sign-off, CTA
label. **Density** low.

## Composition Rules

### Do

- Start every frame on **warm cream**; let **cobalt carry every accent** (eyebrow, numeral, CTA, bar, progress).
- Set headlines **near-black, −0.02em**; eyebrows **cobalt uppercase 0.08em**; numerals **cobalt 600–700**.
- Use **tinted cards** (4% fill, 20% border, 10–14px radius, no shadow); body Outfit 400 muted, line 1.6.
- Keep all chrome **pill-shaped (100px)**; one solid cobalt CTA per closing frame.
- Reserve **atmosphere** (diagonal panel, dots, rings) for cover/closing; content frames keep the slide-header rhythm.
- Lean left on cover/dashboard/split, centered on quote/closer.

### Don't

- No second accent color; no cobalt headlines.
- No drop shadows on content (only the soft cobalt CTA hover); no opaque cobalt borders.
- No square corners (save the progress bar); no font substitutes; no uppercase body.
- Don't use the green/red change chips as general accents — directional comparisons only.
- Don't fill space with heavier borders — add substance; don't blow a headline edge-to-edge.

## Aspect-Ratio Behavior

| Treatment         | 16:9                       | 9:16                           | 1:1                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Cover             | title left, diagonal right | title top, diagonal band below | title upper, dots corner |
| Dashboard         | 3 cards across             | 3 stacked                      | 2×2                      |
| Bar Ranking       | 3–5 bars                   | 3–5 bars (tighter)             | 3 bars                   |
| Pull Quote        | centered, rings behind     | centered, taller               | centered                 |
| Split + Highlight | side-by-side               | stacked                        | stacked                  |
| Closing / CTA     | centered + CTA             | centered + CTA                 | centered + CTA           |

`pad-x` holds on the short edge; re-step display above the 1.4cqw floor. The diagonal cover panel
becomes a top/bottom band on 9:16. Numerals stay Latin Arabic digits in CJK builds.

## Approved Entities

No real customers, logos, or vendors are defined in the source — render any such mark as a
placeholder. Figures, metrics, and quotes are content; the system supplies cream + cobalt + grays.

## Numerals & Claims (hard rule)

Never invent figures, financials, percentages, or dates at frame scale. Render slots as `— figure —`,
`{metric}`, `+NN%`, `↑ —`. Metric cards, bar values, and stat cells especially carry placeholders
until the script supplies them. Directional chips require a real comparison from the script.

## Pre-Render Self-Audit

- **Squint** — one near-black headline or cobalt numeral dominates per frame.
- **Silence** — content frames balanced, not crowded; only the dashboard runs dense.
- **Single accent** — cobalt only; headlines near-black; positive/negative inline only.
- **Type** — Outfit headings −0.02em near-black, cobalt eyebrows 0.08em + numerals; Outfit body muted line 1.6; ≥1.4cqw floor.
- **Depth** — tinted cards (no shadow), soft rounded corners, 20% cobalt borders; no square content corners.
- **Anchor** — left on cover/dashboard/split, centered on quote/closer; atmosphere on cover/closing only.
- **Fabrication** — every numeral traces to the script, else placeholder.

## Known Gaps

- **Motion intentionally out of scope.** frame.md specifies composition only; the source's 500ms translateX transitions + bar-fill animations are deck mechanics.
- **Outfit + Outfit via Google Fonts.** CJK pairing (Noto Sans SC 700 display / Noto Serif SC 400 body) carries over; the eyebrow's uppercase+tracking signal weakens in CJK — pair it with the accent-line.
- **9:16 / 1:1 are guidance**; verify the floor and that the diagonal panel reflows to a band.
- Diagonal panel (clip-path), dot grid, concentric rings, and bars are CSS-only; no external imagery is required.

## Fonts (local files — do not load from the network)

Use `@font-face` with these project files: `assets/fonts/outfit.woff2` (Outfit, weights 100–900), `assets/fonts/manrope.woff2` (Manrope, 200–800), `assets/fonts/jetbrainsmono.woff2` (JetBrains Mono, 100–800). Paths are relative to the project root (`../../assets/fonts/…` from `compositions/frames/`).
